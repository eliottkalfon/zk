# Reacting to setbacks

In the last few weeks, I have come across several ideas or thoughts on dealing with adversity. The purpose of this page to centralise them for later use

- When faced with a tough situation: "what is this situation trying to teach me?"
- Oliver Burkeman: "what is the life task here?" -> what is the wider purpose, why is this something to be done or to endure
- The Knowledge Project 184: when faced an event, you have the choice between two narratives; victim and survivor
	- I found this one particularly useful when dealing with my past
	- The idea of locus of control is useful there
- [[Four pillars of integrity]]

This note does not end there. The idea is to collate different bits of practical knowledge in one place
