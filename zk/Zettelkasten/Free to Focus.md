# Free to Focus
Author: Michael Hyatt
ISBN: 0801093945

Breaks down activities into four categories, based on levels of interest and proficiency (High and Low):

| | Low Interest | High Interest | 
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | 
| **Low Proficiency**| Drudgery | Distraction | 
| **High Proficiency**| Disinterest | Desire |
The idea is to focus most of one's time on desire zone/high impact

Other notes and observation:

Interesting ideas on Automation:
- Self-automation: routines, rituals and lists
- Template automation: write templates
- Process automation: document processes and delegate, also use lists
- Tech automation

When delegating, specify the level and scope of the delegation of the task (research, full autonomy, recommendations...)

I liked the idea of the ideal week. Instead of complaining that nothing works as expected, what would be the ideal week, the ideal life? After formulating this, how could I get closer to it?

My ideal week contains:
- No morning meetings
- Dedicated research time
- A lot of walks and sport

Weekly review template:
- Biggest win
- Review prior week
- Designate the weekly big 3
