# Ultralearning

Author: Scott Young
ISBN: 006285268X

Self-directed and intensive learning process, usually sustained over a short period of time.

The author highlights several key components of Ultralearning:
1. Metalearning: learning about learning, learning what there is to learn. Young mentions: concepts (to understand), facts (to remember), procedures (to master)
2. Focus: direct attention and remove distraction
3. Directness: practice the skill directly. If you want a good grade at a test, do practice tests
4. Drills: find weaknesses and practice intensively. In chess, these could look like tactics puzzles or endgame drills
5. Retrieval: memory and understanding go hand in hand, spaced repetition systems, memory and conneections
6. Feedback: get as much feedback as possible, 
7. Intuition: start from examples, develop deep understanding, think from first principles
8. Experimentation: try stuff out, with learning resources, technique and style
