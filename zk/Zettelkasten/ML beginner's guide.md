# ML beginner's guide

I am frequently asked about how to start studying/learning Machine Learning. The purpose of this note is to create a template I could easily send.


Some ideas:
- Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/
	- Engaging tuition style
	- What I used to start ML from scratch
	- Make sure not to buy this for more than 20â‚¬
	- Link my break, but look for anything by Jose Portilla
- Hands On ML with Python by Aurelien Geron: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/
	- Reference book on the topic
	- Good blend between code and theory
	- Good exercises and examples'
	- You can find a pdf online, worth buying the book, a good investment
- The Maths behind ML: Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) https://www.statlearning.com/
	- Open-source/freely available book
	- Good when paired with the course by Portilla (first point)
	- Offers a solid basis for any further ML practice
- My favourite Data Science newsletter: Data Elixir https://dataelixir.com/
	- I have been a follower for the last five years
	- Great to understand what is going on in the industry
	- Weekly cadence
