# Six principles of influence

Cialdini summarised the main principles of persuasion in his book *Influence*. I found Farnam Street's summary well written. Sharing the main points here:

1. Reciprocity: no such thing as a free sample
2. Consistency: being bound to one's previous statements
3. Social proof: if everyone is doing it
4. Liking: follow the individuals one likes
5. Authority: lab coat, job title, age, glasses
6. Scarcity: flash sales, last available, buy now

These could be used as a checklist as some kind of persuasion self-defence.
