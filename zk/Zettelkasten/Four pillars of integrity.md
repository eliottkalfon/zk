# Four pillars of integrity

On The Knowledge Project, Jim Dethmer describes the four pillars of integrity. The idea is that by following these four guidelines, one could live "whole", without betraying a part of oneself. This is an idea that resonated with me, due to my past tendency of pleasing people and sometimes forgetting myself or my boundaries
- Take responsibility: whatever happens, take responsibility, it does not have to be your fault
- Feel the feelings: do not repress feelings, feel them
- Share and be authentic: do not hide away from loved ones. friends and coworkers
- Be impeccable with your agreements: self-explanatory
