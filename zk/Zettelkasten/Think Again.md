# Think Again
Author: Adam Grant
ISBN: 1984878107

Main idea of the book: cognitive flexibility is an important skill. One too easily becomes a preacher of their own ideas. The ability to reconsider based on new evidence is key. Mental habits are too quickly formed out of laziness.

Some observations:
- Preacher, prosecutor, politician and scientist: different attitudes towards belief
- Understanding the other side's arguments better than one's own
- Listening and questioning when discussing or interacting with new knowledge
- Organisations could invite rethinking
