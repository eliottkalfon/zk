Main idea: distraction (as opposed to "traction") prevents us from reaching our goals.

Similar line to Cal Newport, and some could say Ryan Holiday. Many obstacles, individuals, internal triggers will pulls us away from what we try to achieve.

Eyal highlights both internal and external distraction triggers, and analyses how both of these could be tamed to lead to more traction.

Some ideas I really liked:
- Reducing external triggers with DND status and blocking notifications
- Align your use if time with your values
- Focus on the inputs/process instead of the outcome
- Discomfort is evolutional, it is not bad, simply survival of the fittest
	- Get used to discomfort
- Use of pacts:
	- Price pacts - associated monetary amounts to goals
	- Identity pacts - associating one's identity to a practice
	- Effort pacts - making it difficult to opt out (i.e. booking courses in advance)
- Effective team leadership:
	- Frame problem as a learning problem
	- Acknowledge human fallibility
	- Model curiosity
- Distractions help us avoid our reality, shelters us from:
	- Discomfort
	- Absence of other "psychological nutrients"
- "Fun is looking for the variability in something other people don't notice" -> curiosity as a cure to boredom
