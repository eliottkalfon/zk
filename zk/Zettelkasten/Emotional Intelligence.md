ISBN: 9780553383713

I found the book relatively empty. Still a good encouragement to consider the importance of emotions in our psychological life. The idea of emotional literacy is a useful concept. Naming and recognising our emotions is the first step in managing them.

This could be linked to [[Four pillars of integrity]], feeling the feelings and being authentic.

This concept has helped me in my personal life, with both friends and partners
