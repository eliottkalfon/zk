# Collision decision matrix

|  | Reversible | Irreversible |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Low Magnitude | Gut/Coin Flip | Heuristics |
| High Magnitude | 70% rule | Measure twice, cut once |
I like the idea of the coin flip for low magnitude and reversible decision. The "Measure twice, cut once" rule is also good to keep in mind when making tough choices

The use of heuristics is interesting. The idea is: can we use a rule or system to make these decisions.

The 70% rule is very close to the 80/20 rule. The idea is not to wait forever because making a decision.
